Calculates how long it takes users to convert from their first session.

---

### Why it matters:
- Shows typical user decision time
- Identifies quick vs slow converters
- Helps with funnel optimization & retargeting windows

---

### Query Logic:
1. Find the earliest session per user → `first_sessions`
2. Join with conversions → compute `days_to_convert`
3. Optionally aggregate: `AVG()`, `PERCENTILE_CONT()`, `CASE`-based buckets

---

### Business Insight:
- Short conversion times suggest urgency or high-intent
- Long times may require nurturing or follow-ups
