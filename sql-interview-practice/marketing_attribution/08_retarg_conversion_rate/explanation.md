## 🔁 Retargeting Conversion Rate — Explanation

This query compares users based on how many sessions they had before converting.

---

### Why it matters:
- Retargeted users (2+ sessions) often show higher conversion intent
- Helps justify retargeting campaigns and re-engagement efforts

---

### Query Logic:
1. Count sessions before conversion per user
2. Categorize users: 1 session vs. 2+ sessions
3. Calculate total users, converted users, and conversion rate

---

### Business Insight:
- Higher conversion rate among multi-session users = retargeting works
- Low difference? Maybe retargeting isn’t cost-effective
